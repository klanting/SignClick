SignClick is a plugin to simulate capitalism on your minecraft server.

This Minecraft plugin originated in early 2022.

another location by pressing a sign and paying the provided amount of currency.

Now the plugin has expanded to a full-grown capitalism plugin. 
Allowing players to create countries, vote and decide policies. 
Players are able to create companies, buy and sell stocks and so on.
